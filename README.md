### What I learned
While building this I faced numerous unexpected challenges with new concepts such as the Masonry Layout but that helped me learn new techniques and gave me a good insight to 'Pinterest' style layouts. It also helped me practice the concepts I had learned about Typescript. Also, I was amazed at the treasure trove of amazing paintings that India has to offer while looking for assets for the project.

### Future Development
- Add a loader page
- Sizing of images for mobile and tablet devices needs a bit of tinkering around
- Host the page on vercel
